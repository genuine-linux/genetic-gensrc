This is a skin suitable for the Clearlooks GTK theme.

The GUI widget graphics were taken from screenshots,
the buttons were created by myself.

The font is Red Hat's Liberation font (LiberationSans-Regular, 10 pt)
which is licensed under the GNU General Public License v.2; it fully covers
the ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-15 character set.
A few glyphs have been manually revised by me; 4 (U+0034): removed 1 pixel on
the right, colon (U+003A): moved lower point up 2 pixels, semicolon (U+003B):
moved point down 2 pixels, r (U+0072): moved 2nd pixel from the upper left
down 1 pixel, middle dot (U+00B7): moved up 1 pixel, A with diaeresis
(U+00C4) and E with diaeresis (U+00CB) and I with diaeresis (U+00CF) and U
with diaeresis (U+00DC) and Y with diaeresis (U+0178): moved right point left
1 pixel, small letter sharp s (U+00DF): added a 3 pixels descender, letters Z
and z with caron (U+017D and U+017E): created from Z and z and carons from
U+0160 and U+0161.
Furthermore, I have changed a few spacings; full stop (U+002E) and colon
(U+003A) and inverted question mark (U+00BF): moved 1 pixel space left,
latin small letter v (U+0076): moved 1 pixel space left and added 1 pixel
space right, plus sign (U+002B) and middle dot (U+00B7) and multiplication
sign (U+00D7): removed 1 pixel space from the right.
