          individual implementers to verify that.  Now we need to

	* Merging in core-dev branch

2009-04-07 22:26:07 -0500 Ted Gould (2ffebac)

	* Explicitly sets the about window's window icon.  (LP: #356437)

2009-04-07 22:25:24 -0500 Ted Gould (a8ab75d)

	* Lots of fixes from trunk

2009-04-07 22:22:53 -0500 Ted Gould (c1955c5)

	* Added in an 'icon-name' to make the about dialog have a proper
          icon. (tag: 0.1.5)

2009-04-07 22:17:11 -0500 Ted Gould (13aa4e5)

	* on both client and server side.  (LP: #353112) * Makes it so that
          all objects down to the menu now use the gtkstyle naming
          from FUSA to ensure that they all pick up the theme hacks
          that are set for FUSA.  (LP: #334490)

2009-04-07 22:12:15 -0500 Ted Gould (b2d85cf)

	* * debian/libindicate0.install changed to
          debian/libindicate1.install * New upstream version:   *
          Adds new API for detecting interests of various listeners.
           Implemented     on both client and server side.  (LP:
          353112)

2009-04-07 21:13:07 -0500 Ted Gould (75002ff)

	* Clearing another warning.  Shame gdk doesn't do this one for us.

2009-04-07 21:08:27 -0500 Ted Gould (9a7bcf3)

	* Patch from Eitan Isaacson to correct prototype.  Had to be adjusted
          slightly as the prototypes had moved.

2009-04-07 21:02:08 -0500 Ted Gould (7115f77)

	* Ignoring our new test

2009-04-07 20:52:05 -0500 Ted Gould (eba8697)

	* Patch from Eitan Isaacson to remove a ref/unref infinite loop that
          effectively made it so that we kept our objects forever. 
          While we love them, at some point we need to say goodbye.

2009-04-07 17:40:25 -0500 Ted Gould (3e1e512)

	* Making it so that we don't register the object twice.  This is
          really a work around, but it's atleast fixes the crasher. 
          Which sucked.  We need to work with the dbus folks to make
          this better.

2009-04-07 17:34:45 -0500 Ted Gould (596a5db)

	* Adding show hide server test from Eitan on bug 351537

2009-04-07 15:45:35 -0500 Ted Gould (0b820c7)

	* Moving the install file.

2009-04-07 11:44:47 -0500 Ted Gould (98d4485)

	* debian/control: Switching libindicate0 to libindicate1 to express
          the fact that the binary compatibility is broken.

2009-04-07 11:43:02 -0500 Ted Gould (7f23e11)

	* I finally understood what seb128 told me about the version
          numbering. I feel so stupid for not understanding before
          :)

2009-04-07 10:15:39 -0500 Ted Gould (912a2a1)

	* Hiding some debugging messages.

2009-04-07 10:14:00 -0500 Ted Gould (9bd1519)

	* Simplifying error message

2009-04-06 21:44:50 -0500 Ted Gould (8b71317)

	* Fixes for dev stuff.

2009-04-06 21:42:16 -0500 Ted Gould (42492db)

	* * Some debug messages * Making the comparison of interests detect
          changings properly * Correctly use g_list_remove in
          several cases making for long lists * Using g_list_prepend
          instead of append because it's faster. * Checking whether
          we've got proxies before destroying them.

2009-04-03 15:09:55 -0500 Ted Gould (f252656)

	* Header fixes

2009-04-03 15:09:30 -0500 Ted Gould (5f46d7f)

	* Merge from upstream for header file fixes.

2009-04-03 15:09:06 -0500 Ted Gould (06dd63a)

	* Moving private interests out of the public header file.

2009-04-03 12:50:10 -0500 Ted Gould (76c68f9)

	* Merging in dev stuff.  This'll break things.

2009-04-03 12:48:28 -0500 Ted Gould (5e3c75a)

	* Merge in from the Dev branch

2009-04-03 12:47:23 -0500 Ted Gould (05b5aa4)

	* Not quite sure how these got added, but I'm not going to fight it.

2009-04-03 12:45:38 -0500 Ted Gould (4f5d2b5)

	* Trying to get to a sane state.  I apparently don't know as much
          about library versioning as I thought I did.

2009-04-03 12:27:31 -0500 Ted Gould (d93da3d)

	* Hiding all of the functions that part of the DBus interface in that
          now they're all prefixed with '_' so that they don't get
          exported as part of the library symbols.  This should
          simplify everything a little bit for implementors.

2009-04-03 12:14:07 -0500 Ted Gould (eb5078b)

	* Getting rid of everything starting with 'd'.  This gets rid of the
          dbus stuff that isn't set up to be static, which is silly.

2009-04-03 11:32:35 -0500 Ted Gould (be4c002)

	* Hiding the marshsallers from the libraries in the symbols by adding
          a _ in front of them.

2009-04-03 11:28:44 -0500 Ted Gould (303c52b)

	* Cleaning up the exported symbols, make sure that 'get_type_cb'
          isn't exported

2009-04-03 10:51:10 -0500 Ted Gould (c9b2fe4)

	* Getting to version 0.2.0

2009-04-03 10:49:56 -0500 Ted Gould (68d7bf9)

	* Trying to have more style information included so that we can get
          rid of the focus line.

2009-04-03 10:36:10 -0500 Ted Gould (16abe6d)

	* Adding interests on new servers saying that we're displaying the
          indicators and in the server.

2009-04-03 10:22:20 -0500 Ted Gould (96c1883)

	* Fleshing out the functions in the listener to set interests.

2009-04-02 16:38:47 -0500 Ted Gould (68fb067)

	* Putting in some protection from crazy values

2009-04-02 16:36:27 -0500 Ted Gould (2f66ceb)

	* Hiding debug

2009-04-02 16:35:38 -0500 Ted Gould (5c9e92e)

	* Adding a bunch of debugging messages and fixing the lifecycle for
          the folk pointer.  Lots'o'fun.  But things seem to be
          working.

2009-04-02 16:12:19 -0500 Ted Gould (6826848)

	* Filling in the dbus owner changing code.  Now we should catch
          those.

2009-04-02 16:11:34 -0500 Ted Gould (1554425)

	* Adding printouts for interest changes.

2009-04-02 15:23:10 -0500 Ted Gould (26bfe1c)

	* Connecting in the DBus messaging that we need.

2009-04-02 14:08:55 -0500 Ted Gould (6e42996)

	* Fleshing out the interest setting and removing functions.

2009-04-02 13:35:20 -0500 Ted Gould (aa7ec58)

	* Updating unused file

2009-04-02 13:34:40 -0500 Ted Gould (f94b485)

	* Adding in folks support.

2009-04-02 11:34:56 -0500 Ted Gould (1212c8e)

	* Adding the interest removed and interest added signals in.

2009-04-02 11:11:20 -0500 Ted Gould (5ebb3c4)

	* Woot!  Now we have some real functions to call!

2009-04-02 11:05:35 -0500 Ted Gould (b874768)

	* I can't believe I messed up this one.  Luckily it doesn't seem to
          have caused any bugs.  Man.

2009-04-02 10:49:35 -0500 Ted Gould (6e51efb)

	* Switching around the show_interest and remove_interest functions so
          that they are now asyncronous.  Not that being
          asynchronous is important but more that now they get the
          Method Invocation interface that we can use to find out
          the sender of the message.  Changed various APIs as a
          result of this, and moved the DBus functions to be
          internal.

2009-04-01 15:54:55 -0500 Ted Gould (58403a8)

	* Adding new functions show_interest and remove_interest into the
          API.  Now to fill in the backend.

2009-04-01 15:27:42 -0500 Ted Gould (966a1e5)

	* Adding a remove and show interest

2009-04-01 15:23:31 -0500 Ted Gould (bae37d9)

	* Change the API so it's more like we're keeping a list of what, and
          who are interested in.  This'll make it easier for us to
          manage all the DBus nastyness.

2009-04-01 14:56:31 -0500 Ted Gould (e6287ab)

	* Adding stuff to ignore, much better

2009-04-01 14:50:13 -0500 Ted Gould (7fea958)

	* Misspelling

2009-04-01 14:49:02 -0500 Ted Gould (b76642f)

	* Getting some interests in the game.

2009-04-01 13:21:55 -0500 Ted Gould (589454c)

	* Switch to searching on the connection, which is really what we care
          about and the proxy is a poor sustitute for.

2009-04-01 12:37:24 -0500 Ted Gould (f7bf54a)

	* First pass at the pretty meag-change to make it so that we can
          detect people on the system vs. the session bus. 
          Basically reworking a bunch of structures.  Fun.

2009-03-30 09:31:49 +0200 Martin Pitt (4134dd0)

	* releasing version 0.1.4-0ubuntu1

2009-03-30 09:31:21 +0200 Martin Pitt (1b7e454)

	* * New upstream version   * Changing the text in the license box to
          make sense. (LP: #346215)   * Call GNOME Program Init to
          initialize all of the ATK and gettext     stuff that needs
          to be initialized for it all to work.  Patch from    
          Eitan Isaacson.  (LP: #349031)   * Give the indicator
          applet an ATK name so it can be found by the    
          accessibility frameworks.  Patch from Eitan Isaacson. 
          (LP: #349031)   * Making it so the 'No Indicators'
          situation uses a label instead of a     desensitized menu
          item to allow right click through.  (LP: #346359)   *
          Remove the making of 'Indicator Applet Factory'
          translatable.     (LP: #349540)   * Make sure translations
          get loaded and make the 'No Indicators' error     and the
          license translatable.  Patch from Gabor Kelemen.  (LP:
          #349998) * debian/control: Adding libgnomeui-dev as a
          dependency as it was added   upstream.

2009-03-27 23:42:04 -0500 Ted Gould (9a1d935)

	* Now in jaunty

2009-03-27 23:39:31 -0500 Ted Gould (3e8de8a)

2009-03-27 23:35:44 -0500 Ted Gould (f4b6ce1)

	* debian/control: Add dependency to indicator-messages; the applet is
          currently fairly useless without it. (LP: #346359)

2009-03-27 23:34:45 -0500 Ted Gould (3151d53)

	* Switching the case for 'No Indicators' to make it a label to still
          support right click through.

2009-03-26 16:01:46 -0500 Ted Gould (1f7ae08)

	* Changing version number (tag: 0.1.3)

2009-03-17 19:45:03 -0500 Ted Gould (6c97fee)

	* releasing version 0.1.2-0ubuntu3~ted4

	* releasing version 0.1.2-0ubuntu3~ted3

2009-03-17 13:39:45 -0500 Ted Gould (321d1da)

	* Removing all the gobject stuff from the debian build files

2009-03-17 13:38:36 -0500 Ted Gould (d4d1a0e)

	* Getting explicit disable

2009-03-17 13:38:20 -0500 Ted Gould (ec34124)

	* Seems that we still get errors without it being there, I'm not sure
          why, but making it so that we can explicitly disable the
          gobject-introspection.  That should work for now.

2009-03-17 11:29:15 -0500 Ted Gould (bbf57e6)

	* releasing version 0.1.2-0ubuntu3~ted2

2009-03-17 11:28:51 -0500 Ted Gould (95e61d1)

2009-03-17 10:55:22 +0100 Martin Pitt (78eda23)

	* debian/copyright: Fix download location.

2009-03-17 10:54:24 +0100 Martin Pitt (f5f204a)

	* Add bzr-builddeb configuration (merge mode). Fortunately this
          doesn't insist on having *only* debian/ in bzr. This gives
          us the best of both worlds, bzd-bd auto-downloading
          orig.tar.gz and merging in the pre-generated autoconf
          stuff, and retaining the possibility of merging directly
          from trunk, since we keep the full upstream source in this
          branch.

2009-03-17 10:51:56 +0100 Martin Pitt (2a0f3ae)

	* Add debian/watch.

	* This function seems to set up the widget correctly with the
          background.  It's undocumented, but most other applets

          upstream branch and the other as the packaging branch.

2009-02-15 21:58:08 -0600 Ted Gould (524e5b9)

	* Adding a handler for the new server display signal, and then make
          the messages more clear between the two.

2009-02-15 21:53:55 -0600 Ted Gould (3a3a6e5)

	* Adding a new signal in that handles the ID of zero, or null,
          comming back from a listener and uses that to show the
          server.  Or atleast signal it to figure out how to do
          that.  Also cleaning up the signals a little to use
          defines.

2009-02-15 21:40:46 -0600 Ted Gould (0e0780f)

	* Adding a check for NULL string in the icon parsing code.  This will

	* releasing version 0.1~ppa39

	* Ah, declared a variable in an if so that it didn't get out of
          scope.  Like it should have.  Bah.

2009-02-13 14:55:10 -0600 Ted Gould (17d0da7)

          stream one seems to be broken.

	* Adding in the function to take a pixbuf, turn it into a png, base64
          encode it and then send it across the wire.

2009-02-12 14:03:52 -0600 Ted Gould (1a8b895)

	* Changing the icon data to be base64 encoded, should have done that
          originally, how silly.

2009-02-12 13:47:24 -0600 Ted Gould (52cd253)

	* Seems like a better name

2009-02-12 13:44:45 -0600 Ted Gould (e921d55)

	* Fixing some prototypes to fix warnings and errors we haven't yet
          encountered.  Also setting the type so that our switch

	* Adding in some debug messages and making the signal use the

          time and icon version of the functions so that apps don't
          have to worry about those details.

2009-02-12 08:31:14 -0600 Ted Gould (8a2cf34)

	* Setting the properties property and picking up Empathy's desktop
          file

2009-02-12 08:24:36 -0600 Ted Gould (e1c5a98)

          connection into the proxy_t structure

	* Basically things are working as the proxyts are now findable.

2009-02-11 20:10:33 -0600 Ted Gould (609f0c8)

	* Fixing the call, checking both lists of proxies, and adding some
          debug info.

          around for fun and profit.

          the type of the server.

2009-02-10 16:49:33 -0600 Ted Gould (49220be)

	* Building a way to get properties.  Seems like this should be in the
          DBus libs, but anyway.  Here is the code that compiles and
          claims that it'll do it.  More code than I would have
          liked.

2009-02-09 10:58:05 -0600 Ted Gould (eb7ca97)

          if we're still visible.

	* Sending the type with the signal in the listener, adding it into
          the tests.

2009-02-07 12:37:47 -0600 Ted Gould (af60279)

	* Changing the signals for show/hide to send the type correctly.

2009-02-07 12:21:32 -0600 Ted Gould (455dbe3)

          function as desktop is a property.  Added a property for
          type so that we can understand what kind of application
          this is.  And finally adding show/hide signals on the
          server as they were already on the listener.

          the data in the objects to private sections * Making the
          signal names defines for easier usage * Having property
          changes actually work now.

2009-01-29 13:05:14 -0600 Ted Gould (de80300)

	* Changing the include directory from 1.0 to 0.1 which gives us more
          room to screw up

2009-01-29 13:03:47 -0600 Ted Gould (fab825e)

	* Wow, I didn't realize we weren't handling properties at all
          correctly.  Fixed now.  Whew.

2009-01-29 12:51:48 -0600 Ted Gould (054c9ba)

	* Adding a set property after the show to cause a signal

2009-01-29 12:49:43 -0600 Ted Gould (f5e7d6d)

2009-01-29 11:17:11 -0600 Ted Gould (759d62b)

	* Making all of the server values move into a private section like
          all the others.  Generally a good thing and good clean up

2009-01-29 09:59:19 -0600 Ted Gould (c0a3238)

	* Making the indicator properties private, they should be.  Also
          cleans up some deps.

2009-01-29 09:40:29 -0600 Ted Gould (d898b21)

	* Removing the gobject-introspection-repository from the list of
          build depends as we needed it for the dbus stuff, that
          we're no longer using.

2009-01-29 09:40:01 -0600 Ted Gould (d2f37fb)

	* Removing DBus from the gobject introspection

2009-01-29 09:31:59 -0600 Ted Gould (116ff8e)

	* Oops, forgot the header there

2009-01-29 09:31:00 -0600 Ted Gould (82c65bf)

	* Okay, moving all of the variables from the listener class into a
          private object.  This is to make the GObject introspection
          not need dbus, and thus we can reduce our build deps
          significantly.

2009-01-29 09:10:18 -0600 Ted Gould (ab78f47)

	* Use the new fangled defines to make things cleaner

2009-01-29 09:07:14 -0600 Ted Gould (63630dc)

	* Getting some helper defines for some of the hacks that'll probably
          change in the future

2009-01-29 09:05:09 -0600 Ted Gould (5454aee)

	* Using the defines for the signal names

2009-01-29 09:01:15 -0600 Ted Gould (fea68aa)

	* Making the signals use #defines to make everything a little more
          predictable.  I hate this part of GObject signals.

2009-01-29 09:01:07 -0600 Ted Gould (492652a)

	* Adding a variable to make the compiler happier

2009-01-26 09:13:27 -0600 Ted Gould (b96eebb)

	* Changed to only listen to reference names instead of descriptive
          ones.  Hopefully this'll fix a crash.

2009-01-22 15:39:54 -0600 Ted Gould (b6c1425)

2009-01-19 12:22:21 -0600 Ted Gould (640fb32)

	* Wrong indicate include directory in package config files

2009-01-16 18:37:08 -0600 Ted Gould (dbe2080)

	* Moving the gir file to the right package

2009-01-16 17:12:19 -0600 Ted Gould (7a5bf13)

	* Removing the gir file from the applet so that it's only with the
          library so that we can install all of them.

2009-01-16 16:34:04 -0600 Ted Gould (ba631e9)

	* Adding the GObject Introspection files into the build and the
          packaging.

2009-01-16 16:22:27 -0600 Ted Gould (e3f1f4e)

	* Shell script integrated into the autotools system

2009-01-16 16:21:09 -0600 Ted Gould (ac140d5)

	* Bringing GObject Introspection into the build and making it so that
          it gets installed with the library.

	* Getting the debian package built up so that it can have a seperate
          library binary package.

2009-01-16 13:03:26 -0600 Ted Gould (872812a)

	* Changing the build targets, now I understand the difference between
          'any' and 'all'

2009-01-16 12:58:34 -0600 Ted Gould (913c9d2)

	* Making it so the lib only uses glib (which it does)

	* Adding in the libindicate lib.

2009-01-16 12:47:51 -0600 Ted Gould (8f80127)

	* Moving the tests so that they can guarantee to build after the
          library builds as otherwise they end up getting built
          first.

2009-01-16 12:44:08 -0600 Ted Gould (487239d)

	* Adding in a return that was missing (though it's useless)

2009-01-16 00:04:05 -0600 Ted Gould (2b6ce30)

	* Building the listener object that listens to all of the folks on
          DBus and turns that into a usable interface for indicator
          display folks.  A lot of code to make things simple :)

2009-01-16 00:01:50 -0600 Ted Gould (df1713a)

	* Handling the case that we're destroying an entry because the bus
          told us to.  Properly signalling all of the removals

2009-01-15 23:19:21 -0600 Ted Gould (ad1cc2d)

	* Fixing the printing and the saving of indicators.

2009-01-15 23:11:56 -0600 Ted Gould (fe3addb)

	* Changing the test to do the printing by itself instead of using the
          debug messages in the class itself

2009-01-15 23:01:16 -0600 Ted Gould (0d1e01e)

	* Getting the signals in shape

2009-01-15 21:49:28 -0600 Ted Gould (2722037)

	* Okay, adding the other signals in and keeping track of the
          indicators that are hanging around.  Now, to connect to
          things external.

2009-01-15 20:34:39 -0600 Ted Gould (0ff1165)

	* Get the type of the list of indicators that we got, and then set
          the up to register

2009-01-15 20:10:38 -0600 Ted Gould (fb5b330)

	* Now correctly calling the get indicators function to get the
          indicators on already created objects.

2009-01-15 19:49:23 -0600 Ted Gould (e50f228)

	* Adding in a marshaller for the DBus signals that we need

2009-01-15 17:10:36 -0600 Ted Gould (d1c2ed2)

	* Now doing some DBus listening and getting some of the initial
          configuration built up.

2009-01-15 17:10:14 -0600 Ted Gould (421cea2)

	* Changing to the dbus interface and changing to build teh client and
          server interfaces

2009-01-15 15:52:40 -0600 Ted Gould (4c623e4)

	* Amazing how a little string can make such a huge difference.

2009-01-15 15:48:38 -0600 Ted Gould (da2657e)

	* Adding in a basic listening test

2009-01-15 15:42:16 -0600 Ted Gould (6ba4025)

	* Adding a new function

2009-01-15 15:33:00 -0600 Ted Gould (441032c)

	* Starting to flesh out the listener a little bit, should get a list
          of names on teh bus at this point

2009-01-15 10:39:51 -0600 Ted Gould (ccac9b8)

	* Adding in the base object for the listener.

2009-01-15 10:39:32 -0600 Ted Gould (48277fb)

	* Cut-and-paste error

2009-01-14 17:12:26 -0600 Ted Gould (8a2369b)

	* Okay, I think this is the end of server and indicator minus all the
          bugs that I expect to find :)

2009-01-14 17:11:49 -0600 Ted Gould (284b3dd)

	* Cleaning up prototypes and type warnings.

2009-01-14 16:31:38 -0600 Ted Gould (bda3bbf)

	* Who the hell would design an API that passes in arrays of strings
          differently than it passes them out.  What an insane idea.
           Oh yeah, properties work.

2009-01-14 10:26:09 -0600 Ted Gould (89bf87a)

	* Merging in code from yesterday.  Got many of the functions working
          with real IDs and making lists.  The basis for all the
          properties stuff is there but it still needs a touch of
          fleshing out.  Also a new test for debugging.

2009-01-14 10:11:17 -0600 Ted Gould (c145922)

	* Chaning the property list parameters to be pointer arrays.

2009-01-13 23:24:39 -0600 Ted Gould (a72a4ce)

	* Man, a lot of work for messing up one explaination point.

2009-01-13 14:18:47 -0600 Ted Gould (82dee94)

	* Making it so that the indicators all have unique IDs

2009-01-13 13:44:00 -0600 Ted Gould (f64b5d9)

	* Forgot to actually add the test

2009-01-13 13:43:32 -0600 Ted Gould (0b4e54d)

	* Ah, we weren't checking if we were visible.  Now things are better.

2009-01-13 13:38:29 -0600 Ted Gould (bba89ed)

	* Return to crashing beauty

2009-01-13 13:38:12 -0600 Ted Gould (3dbe51d)

2009-01-13 06:47:42 -0500 Robert Carr (71820cb)

	* Add script to build GObject-introspection GIR, and boilerplate
          JavaScript test.

2009-01-13 06:43:38 -0500 Robert Carr (27a71bb)

	* Use G_BEGIN/END_DECLS, and put the GOBject *_get_type functions in
          the header file (needed by introspection, but also the
          normal GLib style).

2009-01-13 06:32:44 -0500 Robert Carr (544dec8)

	* Merge Ted's changes. I should have used bzr bind.

2009-01-13 06:31:48 -0500 Robert Carr (35c5045)

	* Add pkgconfig file.

2009-01-12 23:14:09 -0600 Ted Gould (5525628)

	* Fleshing out more functions, we can now return a list of ids.  Need
          to test with more.

2009-01-12 17:22:47 -0600 Ted Gould (cd4f548)

	* Whoo Hoo, we can count

2009-01-12 17:15:43 -0600 Ted Gould (514837a)

	* Fleshing out the whole show and hide thing.  We should also be
          signalling when indicators are added or removed from the
          server.

2009-01-12 16:38:46 -0600 Ted Gould (2dc2f26)

	* Clean up the signal handlers and fixing the call in the test
          function.  Now we're to the point of showing the way I
          think things should be.

2009-01-12 16:17:25 -0600 Ted Gould (3d55f90)

	* Basic show hide support in the indicator

2009-01-12 16:07:22 -0600 Ted Gould (b687b3a)

	* Changing to showing the inicator and make it so that we dont' crash
          right now.

2009-01-12 10:45:34 -0600 Ted Gould (245fdda)

	* Adding in the base functions with pointers and fun stuff like that

2009-01-11 23:51:55 -0600 Ted Gould (bea741f)

	* Adding in signals so that we can talk to the app over DBus.  Nice.

2009-01-09 16:44:07 -0600 Ted Gould (4d93780)

	* Adding in a show to help debugging

	* Connecting indicators and servers.  They create themselves easily.

2009-01-09 16:24:57 -0600 Ted Gould (57b3f58)

	* Setting up the singleton nature of the server, and allow setting
          it.

          future ones easier.

2009-01-08 16:42:05 -0600 Ted Gould (fc3c5b9)

	* Adding in a simple program to crash after 15 seconds.  Now we can
          add indicators to it.

2009-01-08 15:35:35 -0600 Ted Gould (7e75808)

	* Building a pretty good set of virtual functions and getting them
